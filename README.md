# Overview

The purpose of this is for me to learn how to use Unity, and to make a VR game. I think this is going to be a ton of fun! This uses Oculus Quest 2 and Touch controllers.

This game is similar to Beer Pong (also called Beirut). You have an orange ball that you through into a mug, and if it doesn't bounce out you go to the next level. You grab the ball using the middle-finger trigger, and then release the button as you throw the ball. if the ball falls off the field or you feel too lazy to go pick it up, there's a Calling Cube to your right. Grab the cube and the ball will be brought right back to wherever the cube is.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I made this game using a Quest 2, Unity 2021.2.12f1, and Oculus Integration 37.0.

I wrote my scripts in C#, used assets from the Oculus Integration package, and a mug I found in the Unity Asset Store.

# Future Work

* Figure out why the text isn't changing correctly on level 2.
* Swap controllers for hands.
* Moar Levels!!
